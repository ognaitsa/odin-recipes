                </ol>
                
            <h4>For the omelettes: (made individually)</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Whisk 1 egg and 1 tablespoon of milk in a small bowl</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in the pan over medium-high heat.
                        Distribute the oil to make sure the surface of the pan is coated well
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        When the pan is hot, pour the egg mixture and tilt the pan to coat
                        the entire surface with the egg. Cook the egg until the bottom has
                        set but the top is still soft. Lower the heat to medium low.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Sprinkle 3 Tbsp cheese on top, then add half of the
                        ketchup fried rice across the middle of the omelette
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Use the spatula to fold both sides of the omelette
                        over the middle to cover the fried rice.
                        Carefully move the omurice to the edge of the pan
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Holding a plate in one hand and the pan in the other,
                        flip the pan to transfer the omurice, seam side down,
                        onto the plate
                    </li>
                    
                </ol>
