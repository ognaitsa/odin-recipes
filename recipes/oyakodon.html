                <li>1 onion, cut in half and sliced</li>
                <li>2 cups of dashi stock, made with dashi powder</li>
                <li>&frac14; cup of soy sauce</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons of mirin (Japanese rice wine)</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons of brown sugar</li>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Rinse the rice in 3 to 4 changes of water until it is almost clear,
                    and drain off the rinse water. Bring the rice and 4 cups of water to a boil
                    in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer
                    until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Place the chicken in a nonstick skillet with a lid, and cook and stir over
                    medium heat until the chicken is no longer pink inside and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.
                    Stir in the onion, and cook and stir until the onion is soft, about 5 more minutes.
                    Pour in the stock, and whisk in soy sauce, mirin, and brown sugar, stirring to dissolve the sugar.
                    Bring the mixture to a boil, and let simmer until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Whisk the eggs in a bowl until well-beaten, and pour over the chicken and stock.
                    Cover the skillet, reduce heat, and allow to steam for about 5 minutes, until the egg is cooked.
                    Remove from heat.
                </li>
